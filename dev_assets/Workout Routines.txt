Beginner fat burn - 30 min


    Each day is broken into 2 circuits. For the first circuit set a timer for 10 minutes. The second circuit gets 15 minutes. Take 3 minutes between circuits.
    Perform the prescribed amount of reps and go right to the next exercise. Try to limit the rest between sets but if you need it take the time. Keep performing the circuit until the time is up.
    If you finish four complete rounds in the allotted time add 5% more weight the next week.
    Tempo is controlled and steady.
    Use your 15 rep max for each exercise.
    Do this program for 4-6 weeks then change up the exercises.
    Plyometrics and bodyweight exercises can be done with weight if they are too easy.
    The goal is to add more sets, not more weight.
