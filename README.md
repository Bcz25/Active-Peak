## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, NPM bcrypt, NPM connect-session-sequelize, NPM dayjs, NPM express-handlebars, NPM express-session, NPM dotenv, NPM pg, NPM sequelize, NPM Axios, Express, PostgreSQL, and Nodemon. From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode (IDE). Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, establish the database using postgreSQL, and then run the server using NPM run dev. Once you've done this the website will be deployed locally for testing, debugging, and developing.
